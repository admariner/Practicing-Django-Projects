I'm working my way through James Bennett's excellent "Practical Django Projects." 
By the end of it, I hope to have the skeleton for my new sandbox website for a few apps I've been mulling over. To start though, I'll be building just a simple weblog application.

The initial source code for the book lives here, <a href="https://bitbucket.org/ubernostrum/practical-django-projects/src" target="_new">https://bitbucket.org/ubernostrum/practical-django-projects/src</a>
Here's the final code of another reader as well: <a href="http://www.gyford.com/phil/writing/2010/01/14/django.php" target="_new">http://www.gyford.com/phil/writing/2010/01/14/django.php</a>

Any questions? Send me a message or an email. I'm happy to talk.
